information I found while playing with the kinetics.py parameters

As Eric mentioned in class, the real infection rate of COVID-19 in idaho has weekly cyclical spike due to testing results from weekends. This must be kept in mind while playing with the model.

I played specifically with the idaho_infections.csv data

with the base parameters( ), the model infected peak reaches ~1.25 million at ~60 days
